# Paper review/summary instruction

For this assignment, you will write a summary and review of a paper that uses topological data analysis.

You can find a list of potential papers on Resources page of the course website. (Links to an external site.)  Several papers have been added to the applications section, although you are not limited to papers there.  It is perfectly fine to use a paper related to your project.  The rule of thumb is to choose something that uses persistent homology, mapper, or some form of "topological data analysis" for some sort of application.  You can ask for suggestions if you are looking for something in particular.

Please aim for 2-4 pages in your submission, and include the following information in your writeup:

1) Any important definitions not covered in this course, e.g. a new type of complex/filtration used.

2) If there are theoretical results, what are the important ones (usually denoted "Theorem")?  You don't need to state (or understand) any proofs.

3) If there are empirical results, what are the key points?  What are the methods of the paper compared against?

4) What do you think of the paper?

a) Do you think the results are reasonably reproducible?  Is there code or data provided?

b) Do you believe that topology was important in the problem that was being addressed? Why or why not?  What other methods might be used?

c) What do you think was interesting/well done in the paper?  What might you do differently?

d) What do you think would be interesting directions to follow up on in the paper?  The authors might suggest some, and you might have your own ideas.  How might you use the results?

e) What do you think of the quality of the paper?  Do you think the results are interesting/important, marginal progress, or likely to be forgotten?

This is fairly open ended, and there isn't a "right answer" for the most part.  The purpose is to read the paper somewhat critically, and form some opinions.
