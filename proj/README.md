# Project

- Proposal: [link](https://tuanpham96.github.io/TDA-class-Winter2021/proj/proposal/project-proposal.pdf)
- Report: [link](https://tuanpham96.github.io/TDA-class-Winter2021/proj/report.pdf)
- Data: not included as these are unpublished
- Notebooks:
  - [preprocessing](notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb): preprocessing activity data, and building similarity/distance matrices.
  - [tda-extraction](notebooks/tda-extraction.ipynb): extracting TDA features, including data, shuffled and null model Betti curves, persistent features and bottleneck distance matrices.
  - [plot-betti-and-scores](notebooks/plot-betti-and-scores.ipynb): plot Betti curves and summary of a few persistent features/scores
  - [plot-bottleneck](notebooks/plot-bottleneck.ipynb): plot bottleneck distance matrices, construct graphs from them, to compare across different stimulus categories (combinations) and null models.
  - [mlp-actfeats](notebooks/mlp-actfeats.ipynb): train MLP network for decoding stimulus categories from activity-based and topology-based features.
