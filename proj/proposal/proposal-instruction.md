# Project proposal instruction

Please submit a 1-2 page project proposal that will explain what direction you would like to take in the project.

Here is the relevant information from the syllabus:

The project can be individual or in a small group (2-3 people). Group projects are encouraged. The project can involve an investigation into theory, algorithms, applications, or some mix. Weâ€™ll have project presentations (or recorded presentation videos) the last few days of class.

Please include:

1. Any relevant background on the project (you don't need to include anything being covered in the course)

2. At least 1 paper you believe will be relevant for the project. (can include more)

3. What you propose to do.

4. What are the "deliverables" in your project.  Everyone should plan to write a short report and give a short presentation (or create a video), but some may have code or data analysis notebooks.

If you would like to form a group of 2-3 people, you are welcome to do so - just scale the scope of the project appropriately.  If you are forming a group, just submit one proposal with everyone's names on it.

Nothing about this proposal is binding - you may find that your goals change as you begin on the project.  The purpose of this is to start a conversation about what you're going to do.

Keep in mind that the project doesn't need to be original - perfectly good projects would be to try to replicate some results in a paper, or implement some algorithms.  Of course, you are welcome to try something original as well.

The due date for the proposal is Friday 2/12
