\section{Acknowledgement}

The experimental data were obtained from Dr. Christian Hansel's lab, the experiments were designed and data were collected by Silas Busch and Dr. Ting-Feng Lin. I would like to acknowledge and thank them for allowing me to use their data to play around for the project. Since these data are not published yet, I will not make the data public. The codes are available on github at \url{github.com/tuanpham96/TDA-class-Winter2021/tree/main/proj}
