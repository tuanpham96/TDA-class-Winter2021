Submit a project report on the project that you completed in this course.

**Format**: please submit a pdf report, ideally using LaTeX.  Please write the report as if it were a short article.  i.e. have a title, author(s), abstract, introduction, body, and conclusion.  You can use a template or class file for your favorite conference or journal.  Introduction can briefly introduce the problem/data you are using, and some background on any references.  Body will contain any details on things such as any theoretical statements, what the methodology was for any computations, and results of any experiments.  You can have the body split into several sections as makes sense.  Conclusion will discuss any takeaways, strengths/weaknesses of the approach you took, and perhaps suggest some directions for future investigation.

It is perfectly fine to report on negative results.  Say what you thought might happen, report on the evidence that it didn't happen, and discuss why you think things didn't work out and if the negative results give you any new ideas for investigation.  E.g. from the viewpoint of the scientific method you had a hypothesis, gathered data which did not support the hypothesis, and so you rejected the hypothesis - so what is the new hypothesis?

**Length**: The report doesn't need to be very long.  5-10 pages is probably a reasonable range, and it can be even shorter if you can fit in your background/results/conclusion in less space.

**Code**: please submit any code that was important in obtaining your results in a zip file.  Alternatively, it can be made publicly available e.g. on GitHub.  If you have data or anything else you can't share, just make a note of what isn't included.

Deadline is 3/20 at midnight.  If you need a 1 day extension please ask (grades are due 3/23)
