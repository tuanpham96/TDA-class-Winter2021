    \textit{Comparison of persistent scores and features between Purkinje population topology and different null models}.
    (\textbf{a}) Integrated Betti number from data, shuffled data and both geometric as well as block null models (a$_1$), and closer inspection of select few geometric models with dimension $\le 10$ (a$_2$).
    Similarly, (\textbf{b}) shows mean lifetimes and (\textbf{c}) shows persistent entropy.
